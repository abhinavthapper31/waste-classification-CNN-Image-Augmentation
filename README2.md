# waste-classification-CNN-Image-Augmentation
A model to classify images of waste products as Organic or Recyclable. Applied Image Augmentation to images and used basic CNN to classify images using Keras. Analysed the performance using Tensorboard. Detected over fitting using metric curves (accuracy) and addressed it using Dropout Regularization.
